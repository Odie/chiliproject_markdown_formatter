# ChiliProject Markdown formatter

This is a redmine plugin for supporting __Markdown__ as a wiki format.

# What is ChiliProject?
ChiliProject is a fork of [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) a flexible project management web application.
See [the official site](http://www.chiliproject.org) for more details.

# What is Markdown?
(from http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows
you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then
convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).


See [the article on John Gruber's blog](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
for more details.

## Plugin installation

### Installation
 
1. Copy the plugin directory into the `vendor/plugins` directory
2. run `bundle install` to install plugin dependencies
3. Start (or restart) ChiliProject

### Dependencies

* ChiliProject and its prerequisites
* [redcarpet gem (>= 2.0.0)](https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet)


Installed plugins are listed on __Admin -> Information__ screen.

### Extra Goodies from RedCarpet

By default I enabled __RedCarpet__Ê¼s `:fenced_code_blocks` so you can 
syntax highlight you code snippets whereever you like by specifying the
language after three backticks:

<pre>
```ruby
  def puts msg
    Kernel.puts msg
  end
```
</pre>

will render as:

```ruby
  def puts msg
    Kernel.puts msg
  end
```

The plugin uses ChiliProject's built-in syntax highlighting, which is currently CodeRay
